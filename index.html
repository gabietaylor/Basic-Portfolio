<!-- Paragraph 1 -->
<p>Welcome to the cave of wonders! Here thoughts, sweat & finger cramps collide on a journey of web design with an interactive experience but before that let me give you some information of your developer. I was born & raised in New Orleans (laissez les bons temps rouler) but I have lived all over souther states. Experiencing different cultures, ethnicities & traditions has definitely given me a wide range of creativeness. I am pursuing an Aerospace Engineer/Physics degree but took a break to jump into web development. With my seven years of management expereience combined with my development skills, I am a defeintely ready to take on any tasks set forth.</p>

<!-- Paragraph 2 -->
<p>Please feel free to look at my various projects & contact me at anytime!</p>
